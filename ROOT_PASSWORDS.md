# Root passwords #

## 1.Vodafone ##

### Vodafone-Sercomm H300s ###

For firmware versions lower than 1.2.01.06, you may use the following credentials:

Username: superuser       
Password: 4tfbckam

For firmware versions higher than and including 1.2.01.06, you must restore a settings backup file where the superuser password had previously been changed.


### ZTE ZXHN H267A ###

For this particular model, some confusion seems to exist. Different firmware versions have different root credentials. You can try the following: 

Username : root

Password: $Extra,ODP0ptiOns$987%! (in some instances you may need to remove the ! from the end)

OR

Password: 2?w{(h:^6gr7yA)M5

OR

Password: 2?w{(h:^6gr7yA)5 
 (same as previous one, except for removing the M)

### ZTE ZXHN H268Q ###

For ONLY the first ever released firmware, you may use the H267A's credentials. For all firmware versions after that, use the following:

Username: root

Password: p@33_05VOD-(rT!!
